# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project focuses on unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It leverages popular clustering algorithms such as KMeans and DBSCAN for analysis.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Segment customers based on transaction features.
- Visualize and compare clustering results using different algorithms.
- Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to improve visualization and clustering performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Algorithms Applied
- KMeans Clustering
- DBSCAN Clustering
- PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction

## 📁 Files
- `clustring1.ipynb`: The main notebook that includes data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization steps.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
