 🤖 Gemini API Quickstart Guide

Welcome! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to explore and interact with **Gemini models** created by **Google DeepMind**.

Gemini models are **multimodal**, which means they can understand and generate across **text, images, code, and audio** — making them powerful tools for advanced AI applications.

## 📘 Contents

- `app.ipynb`: Main notebook with examples and guidance for getting started with Gemini.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and setup instructions.
