# Email Spam Classification using Random Forest & Logistic Regression

This project focuses on classifying emails as **spam or not spam** using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of classification algorithms like **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `classification_and_ranfomForest.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full implementation and visualizations.
- `email_classification_data.csv`: Dataset used in the notebook (you need to provide this file in the same directory).

## üìä Features
- Data cleaning & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Label encoding & scaling
- Feature selection using `SelectKBest`
- Model training with:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation with accuracy and classification report

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
